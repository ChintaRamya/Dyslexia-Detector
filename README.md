# Dyslexia-Detector
<p>Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental condition that impacts reading fluency, writing accuracy, and phonological awareness. Detecting it early is crucial for providing effective support and tailored learning strategies. Traditionally, dyslexia is identified through behavioral observations and standardized assessments conducted by professionals. However, with advancements in artificial intelligence and visual processing, modern systems now offer more objective and accessible alternatives. By tracking eye movement patterns and analyzing handwriting characteristics, these systems can identify subtle indicators associated with dyslexic behavior.
  Real-time monitoring of gaze direction and pupil movement helps reveal reading difficulties, while image-based handwriting analysis detects irregularities in letter formation and spacing. Through the use of intelligent algorithms and pattern recognition techniques, such solutions provide accurate, data-driven assessments that enhance traditional methods. This integration of technology supports earlier, more efficient detection and paves the way for personalized educational interventions.</p>
